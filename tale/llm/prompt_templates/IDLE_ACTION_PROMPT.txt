You are going to generate an action on behalf of {character_name}.
<context>Sentiments towards characters: {sentiments}; History: {history}; Location: {location}; Acting character: {character}</context>
Choose an item from: {items}, or a character from:{characters}, to interact with, or perform a solo action. Do not make up new characters. 
The action could build on past events, but should not repeat a past event. The action should be ephemeral, immersion building, and not affect states of items or characters. If set, act according to the 'roleplay_prompt'. 
Write what {character_name} does, in present tense third person point of view. Don't write what {character_name} thinks, or what the player (You) or anyone else does. Use less than 40 words.
